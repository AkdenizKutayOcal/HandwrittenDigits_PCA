As a part of the school project, we were asked to be analysing handwritten digits dataset. 
Each digit is an 8x8 image; hence each handwritten digit is represented by 64 features. 
The dataset is also tagged. Our task was to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to 
two (k=2) using PCA algorithm, so that we can plot the data and observe how different 
handwritten digits are similar to each other. We were not allowed to use PCA class in scikit.
The analysis can be found in the pdf file that is provided.
